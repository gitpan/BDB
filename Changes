	- some updates for db 4.6.
        - vastly improved documentation, i.e. there is some now.
        - this module has been tested a lot in the Crossfire TRT server.

0.5  Sun Jul  8 16:57:03 CEST 2007
	- port to db 4.4.20 (probably any 4.4 version).
        - added bdb error constants.

	- shared code between IO::AIO and BDB.
        - upgrade to xthread.h from IO::AIO for win32 compatibility.
