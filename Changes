Revision history for perl module BDB.

1.42 Tue Dec 25 15:22:50 CET 2007
	- do not automatically call set_thread_count.

1.41 Sat Dec 22 08:32:41 CET 2007
	- add cursor->set_priority.
        - minor optimisations and checks.
        - port to microsoft pseudo-C again.

1.4  Wed Dec 12 02:20:39 CET 2007
	- new globals BDB::VERSION and ..VERSION_STRING.
        - add db_upgrade.
        - do not die in DESTROY after explicit db_close and similar
          operations.

1.3  Fri Dec  7 14:36:25 CET 2007
        - db_put and c_put leaked memory like hell (reported by Danny).
	- de-IO::AIO-ify the documentation.
        - port to microsofts pseudo-C from hell.
        - added mutex_set_increment, mutex_set_tas_spins
          and mutex_set_max, mutex_set_align.

1.2  Tue Dec  4 11:12:47 CET 2007
	- after fork, invest some work to make sure that the poll_fileno
          stays stable (by dup2'ing the new fd over the old one), to make
          it easier for programs/libs that don't control their forking
          behaviour and cannot recreate their watchers.
        - added missing DB::RDONLY (reported by Danny).

1.1  Sun Sep 16 20:15:55 CEST 2007
	- flag and check TXN_DEADLOCK flag for easier transaction
          programming (see db_txn_finish).
        - new custom db_txn_finish request.
	- improved docs.

1.0  Mon Aug 13 14:02:42 CEST 2007
	- some updates for db 4.6.
        - vastly improved documentation, i.e. there is some now.
        - this module has been tested a lot in the Crossfire TRT server.

0.5  Sun Jul  8 16:57:03 CEST 2007
	- port to db 4.4.20 (probably any 4.4 version).
        - added bdb error constants.
        - add set_errfile/set_msgfile/set_verbose.
	- shared code between IO::AIO and BDB.
        - upgrade to xthread.h from IO::AIO for win32 compatibility.
        - port to win32 (there is an unexplainable hang in
          db_sequence_get...).

0.1  Mon Mar  5 20:44:18 CET 2007
	- cloned from IO::AIO.
